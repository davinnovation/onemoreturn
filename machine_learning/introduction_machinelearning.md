# What is Machine Learning?

Find pattern in datasets.

Pattern can be represented in rules, decision trees, (non)linear functions...

Improve Performance -> Task -> with Experience 

## Examples of ML

- Autonomous driving
    - T : driving lane with vision sensor
    - P : average distance traveled before an error
    - E : seqeuence of images & steer commands while human drive

- Manufacturing knowledge discovery
    - T : predict process result ( normal || fault )
    - P : prediction accuracy ( correctly calssified )
    - E : Seqeucne of process sensor data

- Credit risk analysis
    - T : prdict profitable customers
    - P : prediction accuracy
    - E : sequences of credit records kept in a banks

## Types of Machine learning algorithm

on Y = f(X)

Y : output (response) / X : input (predictor) / f : model

### Functional Categorization

1. Regression
    - ( input, real-valued output )

2. Classification
    - ( input, labeld output )

3. Clustering
    - ( input )

4. Association
    - relations of 'inputs'

### Perspect of training sample

1. Supervised learning : regression, classification

2. Unsupervised learning : clustering

3. Semi-supervised learning : data with few desired output

4. Reinforcement Learning : sequence of action to meet goal

### Data types

1. Category data (qualitative data)
    - norminal data : no ordered output
    - ordinal data : rating scale of output

2. Numeric Data (quantitative data)
    - Discrete data
    - Continous data

## Statistics, Machine LEarning, Data Mining, AI

`Statistics` is subfield of mathematics for finding relationship between uncertain variables. (p-value, unbiased estimator...)

`Machine learning` is subfield of AI algorithm for learn from data - predictive power of model

`Data mining` is subfield of database for discover patterns - address to large amount of data

`Artificial intelligence` is subfield of computer engineering simulates human behaviors - mind learning ( not necessary data )
